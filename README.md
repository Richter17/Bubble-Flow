# Bubble-Flow

homework project we working on!

for all particpate when you want to change something please 
add a branch for yourself that people won't destroy one other work

Build Levels rules:
1. All the prefabs in the prefabs folder must be in the scene(not including subfolders)
2. to add fans you need to go to Prefabs->Fans Types and then the fan you want to add
3. In the main camera there is a script CameraFollow, please add the Bubble in the scene to the Target value in the script
4. Fans have properties in the inspector:
	* Fan Force - The force the fan can push the bubble
	* Wind Y Area - the hight of the the wind area, in which effects the bubble
	* Wind X Area - the width of the the wind area, in which effects the bubble
5. When building levels, call each level "Level"+ the level number(no spaces), and to apply the flow of the levels
add the levels to the build in the Build settings(drag the scenes you want and order them by your choice*).
Then go to the GUI in the scene in the insepctor there is a script Level Manager. in the Next Level property write the name of the next
scene in which you want to move after compliting a level. Check if it doesn't throw any errors and you good to go.
6. Wish me Bon Voayage and good luck for you, any question about the code or about errors, please notify me in the group :)
